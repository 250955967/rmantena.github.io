			<p> This project was based on Android and Arduino interaction via Bluetooth. It was executed in 2 weeks time along with two
			other classmates. </p>

			<p> We were able to achieve complete practical operation of turning on or off any electronic appliance running at 230V/upto 5A.
			Key learnings from this project were :
			<ul style="margin-left:20px; font-size:100%;margin-bottom:10px;">
			<li> An <b>Andriod</b> app was configured to send out certain data bits via Bluetooth. </li>
			<li> <b>Arduino</b> was programmed to recieve and understand the data bits.</li>
			<li> Several Relays were connected to the Arduino, which would be turned on and off based on the data recieved.</li>
			<li> Each Relay acted as a switch for certain electrical device working at 230V. </li>
			</ul>

			<p> Based on the input received from the smartphone, Arduino would turn on/off the respective switch to power on/off the electrical devices. </p>
